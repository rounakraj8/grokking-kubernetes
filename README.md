### The goal of this repo is to discuss basics concepts of Kubernetes

#### 1. What is Kubernetes?
`Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.`

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

- It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

- Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team.

- Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
